# The zelynic Innovation Ledger

This page records the research and innovations that define zelynic's
enforcement core. It is the result of the owner's own thinking and
design research, conducted together with AI, in October 2026 —
written simple on purpose, so a new maintainer (or a curious
competitor) can learn the whole engine in one sitting. Each entry
names the problem it kills, the mechanism in one breath, and the
file where the truth lives. The canonical version-by-version history
is `ebpf/src/schema.rs`; this page is the map, not the ledger.

One law runs through everything below: **no daemon, no config file,
no agent** — every mechanism lives in the eBPF datapath or in a
one-shot CLI run, and the kernel state is the only truth. The pure
cores (`ammsp.rs`, `drr.rs`, `math.rs`, `ecn.rs`, `quic.rs`,
`rate_ring.rs`, ...) are `core`-only files compiled into BOTH the
kernel object and the userspace test tree, so every law below is
pinned by rootless unit tests, not by hope.

## The thirteen, in dependency order

**1. AMMSP — Aware Multi Micro Sub-Process** (`ebpf/src/ammsp.rs`).
The subtree hole: a policy written for cgroup A must
police A AND every descendant socket (A/**), sharing one token
budget — a socket born in a child cgroup that did not exist at apply
time must not escape. The walk resolves the policy through
ancestor levels in the BPF program itself, with generation-stamped
memos so a fresh budget never inherits a stale one. Found live by
the owner (a 100kb cgroup's subprocess downloading >1mbps), closed
in the datapath.

**2. Fair-Shared Bucket — DRR inside AMMSP** (`ebpf/src/drr.rs`,
schema v13). When several processes share one limited cgroup, FCFS
lets one loud subprocess starve its siblings. The shared budget is
handed out Deficit-Round-Robin: each member draws a bounded quantum,
unused quantum carries forward, and the aggregate stays exactly the
policy. The starvation shape (one subprocess at ~100%, siblings at
~0%) becomes bounded shares.

**3. CAKE-style flow isolation inside the cgroup** (`ebpf/src/cake_flow.rs`,
`drr_flow*.rs`, schema v20). The same fairness problem one level
down: two flows inside ONE cgroup (a download and an SSH session)
still strangle each other under a single bucket. Flows are isolated
per-connection and scheduled flow-fair, the CAKE insight carried
into a cgroup policer — the quiet flow keeps its latency while the
bulk flow eats its own share.

**4. Per-socket limiting — beyond the cgroup** (schema v15,
`--per-socket`). The cgroup is the unit, but sometimes the promise
is per-CONNECTION: each socket gets its own bucket, keyed by
`bpf_get_socket_cookie`, attributed with no tracepoint. A group
policy remains the shared-budget answer; the flag opts a row into
individual budgets when that is the honest shape.

**5. QUIC-aware attribution** (`ebpf/src/quic.rs`, schema v22).
QUIC (HTTP/3) multiplexes every connection of a session over ONE
UDP socket — so the socket cookie the per-socket and flow lanes
keyed by collapsed all of a browser's QUIC connections into one
bucket. When the QUIC header carries a finer truth (the connection
id), the lanes key by CID instead; short-header CID length is
learned, never guessed. The refusal is documented, never silent.

**6. ECN-first policing** (`ebpf/src/ecn.rs`, schema v19). A policer
that can mark instead of drop should: an ECT-capable packet over
budget is delivered CE-marked and its bytes charge a debt word the
budget's own refills pay back — the sender backs off at the
transport layer instead of paying retransmits. Non-ECT traffic
refuses the helper and drops exactly as before. Debt is keyed by
generation-prefixed budget, so no fresh budget inherits a
predecessor's debt.

**7. Guaranteed minimum** (`src/commands/guarantee.rs`,
`ebpf/src/drr_guarantee.rs`, schema v24). A rate cap with no floor
lets the fair scheduler hand a busy sibling everything: the
guarantee bracket (`--floor` / `--ceil`) writes a minimum the DRR
draw honors before any contention. Validated against the resolved
rates BEFORE the root ask — a contradictory bracket surfaces its
wording with the numbers it would have policed.

**8. In-kernel time-series ring** (`ebpf/src/rate_ring.rs`,
schema v14). Userspace rate math differentiates two counter
snapshots — miss a sample and the peak between them is averaged
away. The kernel keeps the last eight one-second windows per
policed cgroup per direction, so the SHAPE of a target's traffic
survives between polls. The honesty contract: the ring is a
monitor, the ledger is the truth — the ring never invents bytes.

**9. Self-proving enforcement** (`src/commands/probe.rs`,
`--no-test` to skip). "Applied" is a claim; "VERIFIED" is a
measurement. After an apply, the probe runs its own traffic through
the live policy and reads the verdict from the enforcement ledger —
the tool proves its own enforcement instead of trusting the write.
The lock's scope is the apply, never the probe.

**10. Bypass detection, shadow mode** (`src/ebpf/bypass.rs`, rides
`eagle-eyes`). Limits police the cgroup hooks; traffic that exits
through an interface the hooks never see (a VPN, a raw socket
escape) is invisible to the counters. The shadow audit compares the
window's interface-level deltas against what the hooks booked and
flags the gap — detection only, named honestly, with floors that
keep ARP and header noise from crying wolf.

**11. Container-native resolution** (`src/ebpf/identity/container/`,
`docker://nginx`, `k8s://prod/web-abc`). Containers are not a
separate feature — a container reference is just another way to
NAME a cgroup. The URI resolves to the workload's cgroup id through
the docker Engine API or the kubelet, read-only, and every
downstream surface is the same single-lane machinery.

**12. Atomic multi-target with rollback** (`src/ebpf/limiter/atomic.rs`).
A `::` list applies whole or fails whole: pre-flight resolution of
every segment, then a group write whose mutation ledger restores
each policy to its pre-apply value on any mid-flight failure. The
sweep lane (`--all`) deliberately stays best-effort — its target
list is a snapshot of live apps, and an app exiting must not abort
the fleet.

**13. Time-windowed policies, CLI-only** (`--during`, schema v23).
"Block the kid's laptop at bedtime, lift it at dawn" with no daemon
to keep alive: the window rides the policy row itself, wall-clock
translated to the monotonic clock at write time so NTP slew and
manual `date -s` cannot move an expiry. The grammar is one shape
(a span from the apply instant); legacy rows are honored forever.

## Retired by verdict

Honest research includes what was tried and rejected. Both
rejections below are as load-bearing as the thirteen.

- **snapshot/restore — "GitOps for bandwidth" without a daemon.**
  Implemented, live-tested by the owner, and retired whole
  (NIGHT-improve-55, October 2026): a state file you must remember
  to dump before every reboot is a workflow your own script
  already owns, and pins die at reboot with bpffs anyway. A unit
  file re-applying the strict family IS the desired state.

- **Rate limit presets.** Shipped in the pre-v11 era
  (`strict --preset gaming/streaming/background`) and cut in the
  v11 surface freeze: named presets were indirection over three
  numbers the operator already knows, and the alias hid the actual
  rate from the very person responsible for it. The surface kept
  the numbers.

## Reading order for a new maintainer

`ebpf/src/schema.rs` (the version-by-version contract history) →
`ebpf/src/ammsp.rs` + `drr.rs` (the budget core) → `enforce.rs`
(the verdict path) → `src/cli/surface.rs` (the frozen grammar) →
`docs/PHILOSOPHY.md` (why it is shaped this way at all).
