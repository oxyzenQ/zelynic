# ZELYNIC GITHUB TOKEN RESOLUTION (NIGHT-improve-69)
#
# One implementation of "find a GitHub API token on this machine,
# without ever creating a new standing secret" — the gap the owner's
# ask exposed: the actions-pin health check and the version sweep
# read ONLY the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable, so a machine that
# pushes fine (git already holds the credential) still ran the sweep
# ANONYMOUSLY, burned the 60/h shared ceiling mid-sweep, and reported
# live tags as "unresolvable" — the exact half-heal shape caught live
# during night-improve-71's first apply. Resolution order, first hit
# wins:
#
#   1. GITHUB_TOKEN already in the environment (unchanged contract)
#   2. the gh CLI's own auth token ("gh auth token") — zero setup on
#      a gh-authenticated machine
#   3. git's own credential helper for https://github.com — the SAME
#      secret the machine already uses to push, read through
#      "git credential fill" with terminal prompts disabled and a
#      hard 5s timeout (a helper that would hang or pop a dialog is
#      cut, never blocks a commit)
#
# Nothing is written to disk, and callers must never echo the result
# into command output: the sweep's stdout is a parsed contract (the
# health check renders verdicts from it and caches payloads), so a
# leaked token would poison the parse AND land in a cache file. A
# machine offering none of the three sources resolves empty and
# stays anonymous — honest, and the caller's skip message says so.
#
# Usage (sourced, never run):
#   source ".../lib/github_token.sh"
#   GITHUB_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$(resolve_github_token)}"

# resolve_github_token — echo the first token this machine offers
# for the GitHub API, or nothing. Every probe is quiet, prompt-free,
# and time-boxed; a probe that fails for any reason falls through to
# the next source instead of failing the caller.
