# Race condition test — verifies file lock prevents concurrent corruption.
#
# Tests:
#   1. Concurrent strict-single (5 parallel) — only 1 should succeed
#   2. Concurrent unstrict-all (5 parallel) — only 1 should succeed
#   3. Mixed strict-single + unstrict-all — no crash, no corruption
#   4. Rapid strict-single → unstrict → strict-single cycle
#   5. Lock release on exit — sequential operations work after lock holder exits
#   6. Final state verification
