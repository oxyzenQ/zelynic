# ZELYNIC COMMIT-TIME ACTIONS-PIN HEALTH CHECK (NIGHT-improve-40)
#
# The actions-pin health contract's one automatic seat (the owner's
# NIGHT-improve-39 final form: the weekly server-side lane is
# retired — its SELF_HEAL_PAT push credential was the standing-
# secret hassle the owner refused; freshness is contributor-carried
# now). Two seats, one engine:
#   - commit-time, automatic: THIS CHECK — every commit on a wired
#     clone (core.hooksPath=.githooks, self-installed by
#     gate-keepers.sh section 0) reads the pins' freshness against
#     upstream; current costs one line in warn/strict and zero in
#     auto, behind prints the classified table (MAJOR / MINOR /
#     PATCH), never silently
#   - on-demand, maintainer seat: scripts/ci/actions-version-sweep.sh
#     --dry-run to read, --apply to heal — the healed pins are
#     committed like any other change and this check re-reads them
#     (the same version truth and the same honesty rules, one
#     implementation; this script never duplicates that math)
#
# Advisory by default, and that is a design decision, not softness:
# the prebuilt lane contract (check-commit-gate sections 1-2) fails
# closed because parity is a LOCAL fact this machine can always
# prove; pin freshness is a REMOTE fact that needs the network, the
# API's quota, and GitHub's answer right now. A gate that blocks a
# contributor's commit on facts it cannot reach would be a
# dishonest gate (the sweep's own precedent: a push the platform
# provably refuses is never attempted). Strict contributors opt in
# with git config zelynic.actionsHealthCheck strict — that blocks
# on a KNOWN-stale verdict, and only on a known one; every skip
# reason (offline, quota low, missing tool, overrun budget,
# indeterminate sweep) stays a skip, never a block.
#
# Speed contract: a commit must not wait on the network. The
# verdict is cached under $GIT_DIR/zelynic/ keyed on the workflows'
# content hash (any workflow edit re-checks) with a TTL (upstream
# releases re-check even without edits). A cold check runs the
# sweep under a timeout budget; a check that overruns the budget
# skips with a note while a background refresh (--refresh-cache,
# internal) writes the cache for the next commit. A cached hit
# costs zero API calls and needs no network at all.
#
# Output contract parsed from the sweep (stable since
# NIGHT-improve-39): the "sweep verdict: N healed, N kept, N
# skipped" line and the HEAL note lines "SWEEP: repo (file:line) —
# cur -> new ... HEAL". A verdict that does not parse is an honest
# skip, never a fake "current" — format drift fails safe.
#
# Modes (off | warn | strict | auto; default warn):
#   ZELYNIC_ACTIONS_HEALTH           one-shot, beats the git config
#   git config zelynic.actionsHealthCheck   repo-local, persistent
#
# Auto mode (NIGHT-improve-40 fixup 1) is skip-if-latest plus a
# contributor-carried auto-heal: a current verdict exits 0 with ZERO
# output (the "current costs one line" toll is waived — silence is
# the reward for healthy pins), and a clean-behind verdict (fully
# parsed, no api-unreachable/unresolvable — the rc=2 class never
# heals) re-verifies COLD (a cached behind is not a write mandate;
# upstream truth can move under a 6h-old cache), then runs the
# sweep's --apply under its own budget, stages .github/workflows/
# into the index, and fails the commit ONCE: review git diff
# --cached, re-commit — the re-commit reads the healed pins as
# current and stays silent. No auto-amend, no push: the manual
# flow's maintainer-review discipline is kept whole, only its
# typing is removed. A heal that cannot prove itself clean (API
# drop mid-apply, overrun, out-of-bounds write, unparsable
# result) stages NOTHING: the tree is restored from the pre-apply
# backup and the warn-mode table prints — remote facts never
# block a commit. The apply-stage proof is delta-shaped, not the
# sweep's guard_diff: at pre-commit time the index legitimately
# carries the contributor's staged work, which guard_diff (a
# clean-tree contract) would flag by design — so the auto path
# snapshots the changed-file set and the non-workflow patch hash
# before and after the apply, and accepts the heal only when the
# sweep's own writes provably stayed inside .github/workflows/.

#                                    only route to a cold verdict: the
#                                    anonymous 60/h ceiling sits below
#                                    the 70-call sweep floor. Since
#                                    NIGHT-improve-69 an empty value is
#                                    auto-resolved from the machine's
#                                    own credentials (gh auth token,
#                                    then the git credential helper for
#                                    github.com) before preflight pays
