#
# NIGHT-ask-1: the CI gate for tag-triggered workflows
# (crates-io.yml). Ported from the cosmostrix reference's
# scripts/release/wait-for-ci.sh — the same collision class exists
# here: when the owner pushes the release commit and its tag together
# (git push origin main vX.Y.Z), the tag pipeline starts while the
# branch CI (Dragon Guard - CI) is still running on the same SHA —
# without this gate the crates.io publish ships with zero
# serialization, and a crates.io publish is IRREVERSIBLE (a bad
# version can only be yanked, never replaced). This script serializes
# the two: it polls the GitHub Actions API until the ci.yml push-run
# for the exact tagged SHA completes, then requires
# conclusion=success before the caller proceeds.
#
# NIGHT-dinner-1: a second caller now reuses this gate against the
# wholesale workflow — crates-io.yml also waits for the
# gate-keepers.yml push-run on the tagged SHA (WAIT_WORKFLOW_PATH
# override), because the run that actually fails on a stale
# ebpf-prebuilt/ lane is the unfiltered wholesale gate (check 18),
# not ci.yml, whose Rust-surface jobs rebuild the eBPF objects from
# source and therefore build green next to a stale lane. The label
# this script prints derives from the workflow path, so the default
# caller keeps its exact historical log text and the second caller
# gets honest labels.
#
# Semantics:
#   - A ci.yml run for the SHA is queued/in_progress -> keep polling.
#   - The newest completed run must have conclusion=success:
#       success            -> gate PASSES.
#       failure/timed_out/
#       startup_failure    -> classified FIRST (NIGHT-dinner-12, see
#                             below): GitHub-infra failures get up to
#                             WAIT_INFRA_RETRIES automatic re-runs of
#                             the failed jobs; everything else — or a
#                             budget already spent — blocks the publish
#                             (the code the tag points at did not pass
#                             CI).
#       cancelled          -> gate FAILS with a recovery hint. A
#                             cancelled CI never verified the code (the
#                             usual cause: a newer main push cancelled
#                             it via ci.yml's cancel-in-progress). Re-run
#                             CI for the SHA, or re-push the tag.
#   - No ci.yml run exists after the grace period -> gate PASSES:
#       the commit touched nothing in ci.yml's Rust-surface `paths:`
#       filter (a docs-only release), so there is no run to wait for.
#       The unconditional gate-keepers.yml still covered that push
#       (it runs on EVERY push, unfiltered — see ci.yml's header for
#       the split contract).
#
# NIGHT-dinner-12 — the infra-failure carve-out. GitHub's own
# infrastructure fails sometimes: a release-asset URL answering 500
# mid-download (observed: the shfmt pin step, curl exit 22), a runner
# evicted mid-job, a workflow that never started. A red gate that is
# GitHub's fault must never read as a code fault — and an IRREVERSIBLE
# crates.io publish must not stall on it. When the waited run fails,
# this gate now fetches the failed jobs' logs and hunts for known
# infra signatures (curl 5xx/network classes, runner shutdown,
# download faults). ALL failed jobs signatured -> one re-run of the
# failed jobs is requested (needs permissions: actions: write) and
# polling resumes, up to WAIT_INFRA_RETRIES times. The safety
# property: classification can only BUY A RE-RUN — a real code failure
# fails the re-run too, burns the budget, and blocks exactly as
# before. Logs that cannot be fetched are treated as a real failure
# (never auto-retry what cannot be seen).
#
# Env (all provided by GitHub Actions):

#   WAIT_GRACE_SECS    (default  90)  window for a sibling branch-push
#                                      event to register its CI run
#   WAIT_POLL_SECS     (default  30)  poll interval
#   WAIT_WORKFLOW_PATH (default .github/workflows/ci.yml)
#   WAIT_WORKFLOW_LABEL (default: basename of WAIT_WORKFLOW_PATH)
#   WAIT_INFRA_RETRIES (default   2)  automatic re-run budget for
#                                      infra-signatured failures
#
