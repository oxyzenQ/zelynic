# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The changelog is split into per-era files so this one stays navigable
(NIGHT-docs-1): the NIGHT research campaign that built the v11 line
moved verbatim to [CHANGELOG-V11-ERA.md](CHANGELOG-V11-ERA.md); this
file carries only the entries newer than that campaign. The pre-v11
release history (v2.0.0 through v10.0.0) is archived in git history
alone — the owner's NIGHT-hunt-18 call.

## [Unreleased]

### Release Engineering

- **ci: every runner pinned to ubuntu-24.04 — the ubuntu-latest label
  is a silent time bomb (NIGHT-hunt-26)** — every workflow carried
  GitHub's runner-images notice: "The ubuntu-latest label will migrate
  to Ubuntu 26 beginning October 19, 2026"
  (github.com/actions/runner-images#14748). On that date a floating
  `ubuntu-latest` silently starts resolving to a new OS image — new
  glibc, new kernel, new LLVM — under pipelines whose eBPF release
  build is exactly the kind of workload that breaks on environment
  drift. All 11 floating labels across the six workflows (ci, release,
  audit, codeql, docs-ci, maintenance) now pin `ubuntu-24.04`, the
  exact image ubuntu-latest resolves to today, so nothing about what
  the pipelines run changes — the environment is only frozen. The
  compatibility surface stays honestly covered: the ci.yml build
  matrix already builds on ubuntu-22.04 and ubuntu-24.04 explicitly,
  so a future move to Ubuntu 26 is a deliberate, matrix-first upgrade
  (add the label, watch it build, then repin) instead of a
  calendar-triggered surprise. Each workflow's first pinned job
  carries a four-line comment recording the rationale and the
  runner-images issue link for the next maintainer.

### Docs

- **docs: CHANGELOG split into lean active file plus a v11-era
  archive (NIGHT-docs-1)** — the active changelog had grown to a
  1.1k-line monolith where ~98% was the accumulated NIGHT research
  campaign; every future entry would keep making the file harder to
  navigate. Split: `CHANGELOG-V11-ERA.md` (new) carries the frozen
  campaign history of the v11 development line — the NIGHT research
  campaign, 2026-09-17 to 2026-09-19, every entry from the v10.0.0
  stable tag up to NIGHT-hunt-25 — moved VERBATIM (byte-identical,
  verified by diff against the pre-split commit 1026c1f; original
  order and section structure preserved). `CHANGELOG.md` is now a
  lean active file: header, a split note, `[Unreleased]` with only
  post-campaign entries, and a History pointer to the era file.
  Pre-v11 history (v2.0.0 through v10.0.0) stays archived in git
  history alone — the owner's NIGHT-hunt-18 call, unchanged.
  Frozen-record policy alignment mirrors the NIGHT-improve-4
  precedent: check-headers.sh, inject-disclaimer.sh, and the
  gate-keepers emoji sweep extend their CHANGELOG.md exclusions to
  the era file; check-policy.py and check-loc.sh already ignore .md
  files. Codespell coverage of the era content is unchanged (the
  moved body was already codespell-clean in the active file).

## History

The frozen campaign history of the v11 development line — the NIGHT
research campaign, 2026-09-17 to 2026-09-19, every entry from the
v10.0.0 stable tag up to NIGHT-hunt-25 — lives in
[CHANGELOG-V11-ERA.md](CHANGELOG-V11-ERA.md), split out in
NIGHT-docs-1 to keep this file lean. Entries there are verbatim
historical records and are never rewritten.
